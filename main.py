# The Input Function

# looks identical to the print function

# print("what is your name?") outputs the exact text in the function and the code execution ends immediately

# The input () function gives our code some data to work with. 

# When a user is asked a question, the program uses the data provided by the user 

# input("what is your name?") outputs the prompt and the cursor stays in the same line for the user to input the data

# when the user presses enter, the code execution ends, the data is parsed back into the code and replaces the original input code

#  instead of adding text to be printed, a prompt for the user is added in the perentheses to give a hint of what kind of data is needed

#      input('a prompt for the user')

# running the code prints out the prompt followed by a cursor, ready for the user to type the data

# Run input("What is your name?")

# we enter the data eg 'Angela', the data replaces the code

# 'Angela' replaces 'input("What is your name?")'

# to print "Hello Angela", use concatenation

print("Hello " + input("What is your name?") + "!")

# the input() function is nested inside the print() function

# executing the code starts with the nested function "What is your name" before moving to the outer brackets
#Refer to Thonny IDE for a step-by-step breakdown 

#SUMMARY
# input() will get user input inconsole
# then print() will print word "Hello" and the user input

#Exercise 3 - Input Function

# Instructions
# Write a program that prints the number of characters in a user's name. You might need to Google for a function that calculates the length of a string.

# e.g.

# https://www.google.com/search?q=how+to+get+the+length+of+a+string+in+python+stack+overflow

# Warning. Your program should work for different inputs. e.g. any name that you input.

# Example Input
# Angela
# Example Output
# 6
