# The Input Function

# looks identical to the print function

# print("what is your name?") outputs the exact text in the function and the code execution ends immediately

# The input () function gives our code some data to work with. 
# When a user is asked a question, the program uses the data provided by the user 

# input("what is your name?") outputs the prompt and the cursor stays in the same line for the user to input the data
# when the user presses enter, the code execution ends, the data is parsed back into the code and replaces the original input code

#  instead of adding text to be printed, a prompt for the user is added in the perentheses to give a hint of what kind of data is needed
#      input('a prompt for the user')
# running the code prints out the prompt followed by a cursor, ready for the user to type the data

# Run input("What is your name?")

# we enter the data eg 'Angela', the data replaces the code
# 'Angela' replaces 'input("What is your name?")'

# to print "Hello Angela"

print("Hello " + input("What is your name?"))
